### Batch lifecycle

The contact batch will have the following lifecycle:

1. The batch is imported and saved on our database
2. The batch is processed in our infrastructure
3. After this, the batch will have two statuses:

- `SUCCESS`: The process of the batch was successful and the data was sent to the Contact Manager and the feedback was saved
- `FAILED`: The process of the batch was unsuccessful and the data was not sent to the Contact Manager and the feedback was saved

4. You can acess the feedback through and endpoint that you'll read further in this documentation.
